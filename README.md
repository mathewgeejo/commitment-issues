# Commitment Issues ðŸš€

A Python script to generate GitHub commits for profile activity demonstration.

## Features

- Generate multiple commits with meaningful messages
- Creates/modifies files in a structured way
- Configurable delay between commits
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Safe and reversible (creates only text files)

## Usage

### Python Script (Cross-platform)

```bash
# Generate 10 commits
python commit_generator.py 10

# Generate 5 commits with 2-second delay between each
python commit_generator.py 5 --delay 2

# Specify a different repository path
python commit_generator.py 10 --path /path/to/repo
```

### Windows Batch Script

```cmd
# Generate 10 commits
generate_commits.bat 10

# Generate 5 commits with 2-second delay
generate_commits.bat 5 2
```

## How It Works

1. **Single File Modification**: The script modifies only one file (`activity_log.txt`) by appending timestamped activity entries
2. **Git Operations**: Each file change is staged and committed with a random, meaningful commit message
3. **Auto Push**: Automatically pushes all commits to your remote repository without asking

## File Created

The script creates and modifies only one file:
- `activity_log.txt` - Activity log with timestamped entries for each commit

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Git installed and configured
- A Git repository (will initialize one if needed)

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the directory
3. Ensure you have a Git remote configured:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```
4. Run the script!

## Example Output

```
Generating 5 commits...
âœ“ Committed: Fix typo in documentation  
âœ“ Committed: Update README formatting
âœ“ Committed: Add error handling
âœ“ Committed: Improve performance
âœ“ Committed: Update dependencies

Completed: 5/5 commits generated
Automatically pushing to remote...
âœ“ Successfully pushed to remote!
```

## Safety Notes

- This script only creates/modifies text files
- All changes are reversible through Git
- Files created are meaningful development artifacts
- Commit messages are realistic and professional
